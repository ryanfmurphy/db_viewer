This is the SQL directory for SQL schema-related things.

Currently most of the experimental SQL-schema stuff I am including with db_viewer
is targeting PostgreSQL.  Most or All of it can be ported to other SQL flavors,
but currently, many advanced SQL-schema-related DB Viewer features are inteded for
use with PostgreSQL and require manual construction of the database to get them
working.

This directory will become fleshed out over time.
