Object Editor
=============

HTML View For Editing and Updating SQL Rows / "Objects"


"SelectTable" Text Box
----------------------
The top header of the page will either display the current Table,
or give you a textbox to choose a Table.


Form of the Fields
------------------
The fields of the table will automatically be retrieved,
and Textboxes / Selects are provided for you to fill out
the Attributes/Fields/Columns of the Object/Row.

If you are editing an existing Object, the inputs will
automatically be populated.

By default, only the fields that actually contain something
will be sent in the request, unless you are blanking out a
field that was formerly populated, in which it by default
sets the field to NULL.


Next and Previous Links (coming soon)
-------------------------------------
They are analogous to the ones in Table View
but they allow you to see/edit one Object at
a time instead of one Page at a time.
