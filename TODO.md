To-Do List
==========

* support many-to-many and back-linking relationships
    * make the new `Util::rows_with_field_vals()` function a service
    * build out the JS interface
        * click on a primary_key, make an AJAX and the associated data back
        * insert that data into the DOM, html `<table>` style
            * with a `rowspan` in the many-to-1 case

* make filenames consistent - all underscores, no hyphens

* give a helpful error if user didn't fill out the `db_config.md`
